# Vector Search and RAG Guidelines

- **Azure Cognitive Search**:
  - Configure HNSW algorithm with parameters: m=4, efConstruction=400, efSearch=500.
  - Set up vector dimension to match embedding model (1536 for ada-002).
  - Implement hybrid search combining vector + keyword search.
  - Include filters for document metadata and permissions.

- **Query Processing**:
  - Generate embeddings for user queries using same model as documents.
  - Implement query preprocessing to improve search effectiveness.
  - Support different query types (factual, conversational, etc.).
  - Maintain conversation context for follow-up questions.

- **Relevance Tuning**:
  - Optimize top-k parameter (3-5 recommended for chat responses).
  - Apply reranking for hybrid search results.
  - Use semantic similarity threshold to filter low-relevance results.
  - Consider document recency and authority in ranking.

- **RAG Implementation**:
  - Construct effective prompts with retrieved context.
  - Format context to highlight most relevant information.
  - Include source attribution in prompt structure.
  - Set appropriate temperature (0.3-0.7) based on query type.
  - Implement fallback mechanisms when relevant content isn't found.
