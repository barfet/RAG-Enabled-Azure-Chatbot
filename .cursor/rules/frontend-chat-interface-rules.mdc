# Chat Interface Guidelines

- **UI Components**:
  - Create responsive design that works on desktop and mobile.
  - Support light/dark mode following system preferences.
  - Implement clear visual hierarchy with primary/secondary actions.
  - Ensure all components meet WCAG AA accessibility standards.

- **Chat Experience**:
  - Show clear typing/loading indicators during response generation.
  - Implement message threading with clear visual separation.
  - Support rich text formatting in responses (markdown recommended).
  - Display source citations with links to original documents.
  - Include feedback mechanisms (thumbs up/down) for responses.

- **Document Management**:
  - Provide drag-and-drop document upload with progress indicators.
  - Show clear document processing status and completion.
  - Enable document categorization and organization.
  - Include document search and filtering capabilities.

- **User Experience**:
  - Preserve chat history between sessions (local storage or server-side).
  - Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions.
  - Provide clear error states with recovery options.
  - Design for progressive enhancement with graceful degradation.
