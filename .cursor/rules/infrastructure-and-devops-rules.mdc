# Infrastructure and DevOps Guidelines

- **Resource Provisioning**:
  - Use Infrastructure as Code (Bicep or Terraform) for all resources.
  - Apply consistent naming conventions and tagging.
  - Configure proper resource sizing based on expected load.
  - Enable diagnostic settings for all resources.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - Implement trunk-based development workflow.
  - Run automated tests for all pull requests.
  - Use staging environments for pre-production validation.
  - Implement blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates.

- **Monitoring and Alerting**:
  - Configure Application Insights for all components.
  - Set up alerts for critical performance metrics.
  - Implement custom telemetry for business metrics.
  - Create operational dashboards for system health.

- **Disaster Recovery**:
  - Implement regular backups for all data sources.
  - Configure geo-redundancy for critical services.
  - Document and test recovery procedures.
  - Set clear RPO and RTO objectives.
