# Document Processing Guidelines

- **Document Ingestion**:
  - Support PDF, DOCX, TXT formats with appropriate content type validation.
  - Enforce maximum file size limits (50MB recommended).
  - Implement secure file handling with virus scanning.
  - Store raw documents in Azure Blob Storage with proper access controls.

- **Document Chunking**:
  - Implement semantic chunking rather than arbitrary splits.
  - Use recursive character text splitter with 1000 token chunks.
  - Maintain 200 token overlap between adjacent chunks.
  - Preserve document structure (headings, paragraphs, lists).
  - Include document metadata with each chunk.

- **Embedding Generation**:
  - Use Azure OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 model.
  - Set embedding dimension to 1536.
  - Process chunks in batches to optimize API usage.
  - Implement retry logic for API failures.
  - Store embedding vectors in Azure Cognitive Search.

- **Processing Pipeline**:
  - Use event-driven architecture for asynchronous processing.
  - Track document processing status in a database or storage table.
  - Implement comprehensive error handling with detailed logs.
  - Create idempotent processing functions to handle retries.
