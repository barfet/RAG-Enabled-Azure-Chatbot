# Azure Functions Guidelines

- **Function Design**:
  - Create single-purpose functions following SOLID principles.
  - Use appropriate trigger types (HTTP, Blob, Queue) based on function purpose.
  - Implement proper input validation for all parameters.
  - Use dependency injection for testability.

- **API Structure**:
  - Design RESTful APIs with consistent naming conventions.
  - Implement proper HTTP status codes and error responses.
  - Use JSON schema validation for request/response payloads.
  - Include rate limiting and throttling mechanisms.

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Minimize cold starts with consumption plan.
  - Implement connection pooling for database/service connections.
  - Use appropriate caching strategies (distributed cache recommended).
  - Optimize memory usage with proper resource cleanup.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Implement comprehensive try/except blocks with specific exceptions.
  - Log detailed error information with correlation IDs.
  - Return user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance.
  - Implement circuit breakers for external service calls.
